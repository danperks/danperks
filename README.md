## Hey, I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer and student from the West Midlands, UK. <br />
I am currently in my final year of studying Computer Science as an Undergrad at [Coventry University](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/).

Things may be a bit quiet here as most of my work takes place in private repos, I am doing cool stuff behind the scenes I promise ðŸ¤ž
