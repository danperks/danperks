## Hey, I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer and student from the West Midlands, UK. <br />
I am currently in my final year of studying Computer Science as an Undergrad at [Coventry University](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/).

### Top Projects

- [Screeny](https://github.com/danperks/Screeny)
- [Initer](https://github.com/danperks/Initer)
- [The Circle](https://github.com/danperks/theCircle)

### Tools & Tech

I usually code in [Node.JS](https://www.python.org/), with my stack consisting of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and either a traditional DBMS (MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite3) or [Redis](https://redis.io/). I code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on a Hackintosh/Windows dualboot, host on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and containerise with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
